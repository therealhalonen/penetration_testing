*First test or kind of like a pre-test to analyze network traffic*

`I used Debian 11, Lenovo Thinkpad E15`

**Sieppaa ja analysoi verkkoliikennettÃ¤.**

First i installed `tcpdump`

```bash
sudo apt-get install tcpdump
```

I have a device connected with usb, which tethers the ethernet connection, that i use as a system monitor and debug over ssh, but has no access to the public internet.   
I analyzed the traffic between my laptop and my monitoring device:   
```bash
~$ sudo tcpdump -i usb0 -v
tcpdump: listening on usb0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes

``` 

So to analyze it:  
`tcpdump` is listening the given interface `usb0` which has Ethernet link.   
- First packet: Indicates that my laptop, with hostname `parasite` sent a packet to `192.168.186.86` port `42512` using `ssh`.  And if i understand correctly , the package contains `164` bytes worth of data.   
- Second packet: Same sender, same destination. `196` bytes worth of data.   
- Third packet: Acknowledgement from `192.168.186.86` . Indicates that `192.168.186.86`  has received the first packet from `parasite` via `ssh`.   
- Fourt packet: Also acknowledgement. Indicates that `192.168.186.86`  has received the second packet from `parasite` via `ssh`.   

Four packets captured, as summarized by `tcpdump` with zero dropped by kernel.

What i really understand in this, is that there is an `ssh` connection between a pc, with hostname `parasite` and a device with ip `192.168.186.86`.
